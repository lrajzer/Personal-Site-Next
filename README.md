# Micha≈Ç Rajzer's personal site

This is my personal website which is hosted at [rajzer.dev](https://www.rajzer.dev/)

It has double language support (Polish and English)

It uses Next.JS, MongoDB and auth0 as the framework, database, and authentication (for admin acoounts)

It includes my personal portfolio under the [Projects](https://www.rajzer.dev/projects) tab, it allows You to contact me directly through the [Contact](https://www.rajzer.dev/projects) tab and it hosts my [Blog](https://www.rajzer.dev/blog).

There is also a small section for miscellaneous project that are nice as a website but don't require a dedicated one at the [secret](https://www.rajzer.dev/hidden) tab.
